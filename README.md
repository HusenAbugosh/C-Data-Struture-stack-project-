# Project2

In this Project I have to implement a calculator system that reads a number of equations from an input file to be evaluated.
The file will contain an unspecified number of equations written in infix form.
My program should be able to read all equations in the file. and do these following tasks:

1. Read the file containing the equations. The user should provide the name of the input file.

2. Check the validity of equations (either valid or not). The output of this option is as follows.

3. Convert valid equations from infix to prefix and print the prefix expressions.

4. Evaluate the prefix expressions and print the results of each equation on a separate line.

5. Print invalid equations. This option should print all invalid
equations from the input file.

6. Print all equations to a file (output.txt) indicating for each input equation if it is 

7. valid or not and if valid, print out the prefix expression and its result.

8. Exit.
